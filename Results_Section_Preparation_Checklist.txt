Checklist: What to Prepare Before Writing the Results Section

1. Generated Response Data
   - Collected outputs from all four models (GPT-4o-mini, Mistral, DeepSeek, Llama 3.2)
   - Covers different query types:
     • Property-based
     • Group-based
     • Hybrid
     • Multi-turn and single-turn formats
   - Generated at multiple temperatures (e.g., 0.5 to 2.0)
   - Final generation responses with 20 samples each

2. Evaluation Tags Per Sample
   - Chemical validity check using RDKit
   - Uniqueness per query (per-model deduplication)
   - Novelty check against fine-tuning dataset
   - Property alignment (Tg and Er within tolerance)
   - Group matching (e.g., requested functional groups present)
   - Reactive group combination check (e.g., epoxy–imine, ≥2 per monomer)
   - Notes column for failure cases or observations

3. Aggregated Evaluation Summary (per model)
   - Validity rate (% valid SMILES)
   - Average uniqueness per query
   - Novelty percentage
   - Property alignment rate
   - Group matching accuracy
   - Reactive group success rate
   - Dialogue consistency (qualitative notes)

4. Sample Output Examples
   - 2–3 high-quality examples per model showing good generation
   - 1–2 edge/failure cases to analyze limitations
   - At least one multi-turn dialogue sample showing context handling

5. Visualizations (optional but useful)
   - Metric comparison table across models
   - Example SMILES response table
   - Case study box for a sample prompt
   - Optional plot (e.g., diversity vs. temperature)

6. Tools/References Used
   - RDKit for SMILES validation
   - Surrogate model or rule-based checks for Tg/Er
   - Group-matching logic / SMARTS definitions

Make sure all of the above is collected and verified before drafting Section 4.
